# Love2D Experimentation
Some little experiments with the [Love2D](https://love2d.org) game framework.

# To-do
- ~~Numbers in inventory~~ (Needs polish)
- ~~Classes for items/blocks~~
- ~~Movement/scrolling should be smooth~~
- ~~Sprite animations~~
- ~~Sprite flipping/facing~~
- ~~Walking animation images~~
- Crafting system
- Split up main.lua into modules
- Multi tile objects

# Ideas
- Multiple taps to break blocks, make block shake when being broken
- Craftable rafts (walk on/off like it was a tile?)
- World generation with water, trees, rocks

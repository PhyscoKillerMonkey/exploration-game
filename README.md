# Love2D Exploration Game
An experimental game with the [Love2D](https://love2d.org) game framework. My aim is to create a procedural open world game with a item collection/mining, crafting and basic building system system.

# To-do
- ~~Numbers in inventory~~ (Needs polish)
- ~~Classes for items/blocks~~
- ~~Movement/scrolling should be smooth~~
- ~~Sprite animations~~
- ~~Sprite flipping/facing~~
- ~~Walking animation images~~
- Crafting system
- Split up main.lua into modules
- Multi tile objects
- Inventory management

# Ideas
- Multiple taps to break blocks, make block shake when being broken
- Craftable rafts (walk on/off like it was a tile?)
- World generation with water, trees, rocks
- Chests/crates
- NPCs; friendly (cows, pigs, chickens, etc.) and hostile (bears etc.)
- Farming
- Inventory system:
  - Slot or weight/space based?
  - List of items, items have weight
  - Can upgrade with backpack to hold more items
  - Different tabs for categories (building, food, etc)

# Love2D Experimentation
Some little experiments with the [Love2D](https://love2d.org) game framework.

# To-Do / Ideas
- Multiple taps to break blocks, make block shake when being broken
- Craftable rafts (walk on/off like it was a tile?)
- Movement/scrolling should be smooth
- Numbers in inventory
- Classes for items
